<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>SHAKSPEARE AND MARLOWE.</h3>
<p>A special use of, a use, indeed, that gives a special value to
your publication, is the communication through its means of facts
and conclusions for the information or assistance of editors or
intending editors. I do not suppose that any gentleman occupying
this position would be guilty of so much disrespect to the many
eminent names which have already appeared in your columns, as would
be implied in not giving all the attention it deserved to any
communication you might see fit to publish; and with this feeling,
and under this shelter, I return to the subject of Marlowe, and his
position as a dramatic writer relative to Shakspeare. I perceive
that a re-issue of Mr. Knight's <i>Shakspeare</i> has commenced,
and from the terms of the announcement, independently of other
considerations, I conclude that the editor will take advantage of
this opportunity of referring to doubtful or disputed points that
may have made any advance towards a solution since his previous
editions. I have read also an advertisement of an edition of
Shakspeare, to be superintended by Mr. Halliwell<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is to contain the plays of
"doubtful authenticity, or in the composition of which Shakspeare
is supposed only to have taken a part." Neither of these gentlemen
can well avoid expressing an opinion on the subject I have adverted
to, and to them more especially I would address my
observations.</p>
<p>I think I have observed that the claims of Marlowe have been
maintained with something very like party spirit. I have seen
latterly several indications of this, unmistakeable, though
expressed, perhaps, but by a single word. Now it is true both Mr.
Collier and Mr. Dyce are committed to a positive opinion on this
subject; and it would be unreasonable to expect either of those
gentlemen to change their views, except with the fullest proof and
after the maturest consideration. But who, besides these, is
interested in maintaining the precedence of Marlowe? These remarks
have been called forth by an article in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
containing the following passages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All Marlowe's works were produced prior, we may safely assert,
to the appearance of Shakspeare <i>as a writer for the stage</i>,
or as an author, in print.</p>
<p>"It is now universally admitted among competent critics, that
Shakspeare commenced his career as a dramatic author, by
remodelling certain pieces written <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page370" id="page370"></a>{370}</span> either separately or
conjointly by Greene, Marlowe, Lodge, and Peele."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An anonymous writer commits himself to nothing, and I should not
have noticed the above but that they illustrate my position. In the
passage first cited, if the writer mean "as a writer for the stage
<i>in print</i>," it proves nothing; but if the words "in print"
are not intended to be so connected, the assertion cannot be
proved, and <i>many</i> "competent critics" will tell him it is
most improbable. The assertion of the second quotation is simply
untrue; Mr. Knight has not admitted what is stated therein, and if
I recollect right, an Edinburgh Reviewer has concurred with him in
judgment. Neither of these, I presume, will be called incompetent.
I cannot suppose that either assertion would have been made but for
the spirit to which I have alluded; for no cause was ever the
better for allegations that could not be maintained.</p>
<p>In some former papers which you did me the honour to publish, I
gave it incidentally as my opinion that Marlowe was the author of
the <i>Taming of a Shrew</i>. I have since learned, through Mr.
Halliwell, that Mr. Dyce is confident, from the style, that he was
not. Had I the opportunity, I might ask Mr. Dyce "which style?"
That of the passages I cited as being identical with passages in
Marlowe's acknowledged plays will not, I presume, be disputed; and
of that of such scenes as the one between Sander and the tailor, I
am as confident as Mr. Dyce; it is the style rather of Shakspeare
than Marlowe. In other respects, I learn that the kind of evidence
that is considered by Mr. Dyce good to sustain the claim of Marlowe
to the authorship of the <i>Contention</i> and the <i>True
Tragedy</i>, is not admissible in support of his claim to the
<i>Taming of a Shrew</i>. I shall take another opportunity of
showing that the very passages cited by Mr. Dyce from the two
first-named of these plays will support my view of the case, at
least as well as his; doing no more now than simply recording an
<i>opinion</i> that Marlowe was a follower and imitator of
Shakspeare. I do not know that I am at present in a position to
maintain this opinion by argument; but I can, at all events, show
on what exceedingly slight grounds the contrary opinion has been
founded.</p>
<p>I have already called attention to the fact, that the impression
of Marlowe's being an earlier writer than Shakspeare, was founded
solely upon the circumstance that his plays were printed at an
earlier date. That nothing could be more fallacious than this
conclusion, the fact that many of Shakspeare's earliest plays were
not printed at all until after his death is sufficient to evince.
The motive for withholding Shakspeare's plays from the press is as
easily understood as that for publishing Marlowe's. Thus stood the
question when Mr. Collier approached the subject. Meanwhile it
should be borne in mind, that not a syllable of evidence has been
advanced to show that Shakspeare could not have written the
<i>First part of the Contention</i> and the <i>True Tragedy</i>, if
not the later forms of <i>Henry VI.</i>, <i>Hamlet</i> and
<i>Pericles</i> in their earliest forms, if not <i>Timon of
Athens</i>, which I think is also an early play revised, <i>Love's
Labour's Lost</i>, <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, &amp;c., all
of which I should place at least seven years distance from plays
which I think were acted about 1594 or 1595. I now proceed to give
the kernel of Mr. Collier's argument, omitting nothing that is
really important to the question:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Give me the man' (says Nash) 'whose extemporal vein, in any
humour, will excel our greatest <i>art masters</i>' deliberate
thoughts.'</p>
<p>"Green, in 1588, says he had been 'had in derision' by 'two
gentlemen poets' because I could not make my verses get on the
stage in tragical buskins, every word filling the mouth like the
faburden of Bow-bell, daring God out of heaven with that atheist
tamburlane, or blaspheming with the mad priest of the sun. Farther
on he laughs at the 'prophetical spirits' of those 'who set the end
of scholarism in an <i>English blank-verse</i>.'</p>
<p>"Marlowe took his degree of <i>Master of Arts</i> in the very
year when Nash was unable to do so, &amp;c.</p>
<p>"I thus arrive at the conclusion, that Christopher Marlowe was
our first poet who used blank-verse in dramatic compositions
performed in public theatres."&mdash;<i>Hist. of Dramatic
Poetry</i>, vol. iii. pp. 110, 111, 112.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is literally all; and, I ask, can any "conclusion" be much
more inconclusive? Yet Mr. Collier has been so far misled by the
deference paid to him on the strength of his unquestionably great
services, and appears to have been so fully persuaded of the
correctness of his deduction, that he has since referred to as a
<i>proved fact</i> what is really nothing more than an exceedingly
<i>loose conjecture</i>.</p>
<p>Of the two editors whose names I have mentioned, Mr. Knight's
hitherto expressed opinions in reference to the early stage of
Shakspeare's career in a great measure coincide with mine; and I
have no reason to suppose that it is otherwise than an open
question to Mr. Halliwell. For satisfactory proof in support of my
position, time only, I firmly believe, is required; but the first
stage in every case is to remove the false conclusion that has been
drawn, to weaken its impression, and to reduce it to its true
value; and that I have endeavoured to do in the present paper. In
conclusion, I take the opportunity of saying, as the circumstance
in some degree bears upon the present question, that the evidence
in support of the priority of Shakspeare's <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i> to the so-called older play which I withheld, together
with what I have collected since my last paper on the subject, is I
think stronger even than that which I communicated.</p>

<h3>A PLAN FOR A CHURCH-HISTORY SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>The formation of a Society, having for its object any special
literary service, is a matter so closely connected with the very
purpose for which this paper was established, that we shall only be
carrying out that purpose by calling the attention of our readers
to a small pamphlet in which our valued correspondent DR. MAITLAND
offers a few suggestions to all who may be interested in the
formation of a "CHURCH-HISTORY SOCIETY, and willing to co-operate
in such a design."</p>
<p>DR. MAITLAND'S suggestions are:</p>
<p>1. The collection of a library containing the books particularly
required for the objects of the proposed society: and those who
have not paid attention to the subject will perhaps be surprised to
learn that in DR. MAITLAND'S opinion (and few higher authorities
can be found on this point), "A moderate-sized room would hold such
a library, and a very few hundred pounds would pay for it." On the
advantage of this plan to the editors of the works to be published
by the Society, it can scarcely be necessary to insist; but other
benefits would result from the formation of such a library, for
which we may refer, however, to the pamphlet itself.</p>
<p>The next points treated of are the works to be undertaken by the
Society; which may briefly be described as</p>
<p>2. New and corrected editions of works already known and
esteemed; critical editions, for instance, of such well-known
writers as Fox, Fuller, Burnet, and Strype: and the completion, by
way of "posting up," of such as have become defective through lapse
of time, like Le Neve's <i>Fasti</i>, Godwin's <i>De
Presulibus</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>3. The compilation of such original works as may be considered
desiderata. A General Church-History on such a scale, and so far
entering into details as to interest a reader, is not to be found
in our language; nor has the Church of England any thing like the
<i>Gallia Christiana</i> or <i>Italia Sacra</i>. We mention these
merely as instances, referring, of course, for further illustration
to the pamphlet itself, merely quoting the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But on the subject of publication, I must add one thing more,
which appeals to me to be of vital importance to the respectability
and efficiency of such a Society. It must not build its hopes, and
stake its existence, on the cupidity of subscribers&mdash;it must
not live on appeals to their covetousness&mdash;it must not be, nor
act as if it were, a joint-stock company formed to undersell the
trade. It must not rest on the chance of getting subscribers who
will shut their eyes, and open their mouths, and take what is given
them, on a mere assurance that it shall be more in quantity for the
money, than a bookseller can afford to offer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR. MAITLAND's fourth section, on the <i>Discovery of
Materials</i>, tempts us to further extracts. After remarking
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It would be a most important and valuable part of the Society's
work to discover in various ways&mdash;chiefly by the employing fit
persons to look for, inspect, and make known&mdash;such materials
for Church-History as remain unpublished."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That no person, not wholly illiterate and ignorant of
Church-History, could go about the metropolis only, seeking after
such matters during one month, without gathering into his note-book
much valuable matter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Doctor proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By those who have not been led to consideration or inquiry upon
the subject, this may be deemed a mere speculation; but those who
are even slightly acquainted with the real state of things, will, I
believe agree with me that if men, respectable and in earnest and
moderately informed, would only set about the matter, they would
soon be astonished at the ease and rapidity with which they would
accumulate interesting and valuable matter. Transcribing and
printing, it is admitted, are expensive processes, and little could
be effected by them at first; but merely to make known to the world
by hasty, imperfect, even blundering, lists or indexes, that things
unsought and unknown <i>exist</i>, would be an invaluable
benefit."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We pass over the section on <i>Correspondence</i>, and that on
the establishment of <i>Provincial Societies</i>; but from the
last, <i>On the Privileges of Members</i>, we quote at even greater
length.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is but honest to confess in plain terms, that the chief and
most obvious privilege of members at first, is likely to be little
more than a satisfactory belief that they are doing a good work,
and serving their generation. In a word, the nicely-balanced
<i>quid pro quo</i> is not offered. It might be prudent for the
present to confine one's self to a positive assurance that the
Society will, at the worst, make as good a return as several other
societies formed for the promotion and cultivation of other
branches of knowledge. If subscribers will only be content to pay
as much, and receive as little, as the fellows of the Royal and
Antiquarian Societies, the Church-History Society will thrive. But
considering the nature and object of the proposed Society, I cannot
help expressing my confidence that there are many Christian people
who will give their money freely, and no more wish to have part of
it returned, than if they had put it into a plate at a
church-door&mdash;let them only be satisfied that it will not be
embezzled or turned into waste paper.</p>
<p>"At the same time, the members of the Society might derive some
legitimate benefits. They would have constantly increasing
advantages from the use of their library, which would gradually
become, not only rich in books, but in transcripts, catalogues,
indexes, notices, &amp;c., not to be found together elsewhere. Of
all these they would have a right to as much use and advantage as
joint-proprietors could enjoy without hindrance to each other. With
regard to works published by the Society, they might reasonably
expect to be supplied <span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id=
"page372"></a>{372}</span> with such as they should choose to
possess, on the same terms as if they were the authors, or the
owners of the copyright. These, however, are details which, with
many others, must be settled by the managers; they are not
mentioned as matters of primary importance or inducement."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR. MAITLAND concludes by observing, that he should not have
ventured to publish his plan, had he not been encouraged to do so
by some whose judgment he respected; and by inviting all who may
approve or sanction the plan, to make known (either by direct
communication to himself, or in any other way) their willingness to
support such a Society, and the amount of contribution, or annual
donation, which, if the design is carried out, may be expected from
them. Of course such expressions of opinion would be purely
conditional, and would not pledge the writers to support the
Society if, when organised, they did not approve of the
arrangements; but it is clear no such arrangements can well be made
until something, is known as to the amount of support which may be
expected.</p>
<p>We have entered at some length upon this <i>Plan of a
Church-History Society</i>, and have quoted largely from DR.
MAITLAND's pamphlet, because we believe the subject to be one
likely to interest a large body of our readers, who might otherwise
not have their attention called to a proposal calculated to advance
one of the most important branches of historical learning.</p>

<h3>BURNET AS A HISTORIAN.</h3>
<p>The following extract from Charles Lamb ought to be added to the
<i>testimonia</i> already given by "NOTES AND QUERIES" (Vol. i.,
pp. 40. 181. 341. 493.):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Burnet's Own Times.</i>&mdash;Did you ever read that
garrulous, pleasant history? He tells his story like an old man
past political service, bragging to his sons on winter evenings of
the part he took in public transactions when his 'old cap was new.'
Full of scandal, which all true history is. So palliative; but all
the stark wickedness that actually gives the <i>momentum</i> to
national actors. Quite the prattle of age and outlived importance.
Truth and sincerity staring out upon you perpetually <i>in alto
relievo</i>. Himself a party-man, he makes you a party-man. None of
the cursed philosophical Humeian indifference, 'so cold and
unnatural and inhuman.' None of the cursed Gibbonian fine writing,
so fine and composite. None of Dr. Robertson's periods with three
members. None of Mr. Roscoe's sage remarks, all so apposite and
coming in so clever, lest the reader should have had the trouble of
drawing an inference. Burnet's good old prattle I can bring present
to my mind; I can make the Revolution present to
me."&mdash;<i>Charles Lamb: Letters</i>.</p>

<h3>MISTAKES ABOUT GEORGE CHAPMAN THE POET.</h3>
<p>Dr. W. Cooke Taylor, in the introduction to his elegant reprint
of <i>Chapman's Homer</i>, says of George Chapman, that "he died on
the 12th of May, 1655, and was buried at the south side of St.
Giles's Church." The date here is an error; for 1655 we should read
1634.</p>
<p>Sir Egerton Brydges, in his edition of Phillip's <i>Theatrum
Poetarum</i> (Canterbury, 1800, p. 252.), says of the same poet, "A
monument was erected over his grave by Inigo Jones, which was
destroyed with the old church." Here also is an error. Inigo
Jones's altar-tomb to the memory of his friend is still to be seen
in the churchyard, against the south wall of the church. The
inscription, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id=
"page373"></a>{373}</span> which has been imperfectly re-cut, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>There is no proof that Inigo Jones's tomb now occupies its
original site. The statement that Chapman was studied on the south
side of the church is, I believe, mere conjecture.</p>

<i>Rolliad</i>, with the names of most of the contributors, taken
from a copy belonging to Dr. Lawrence, the editor of the volume,
and author of many of the articles. In the margin of "Jekyll,"
lines 73. to 100. are stated to be "inserted by Tickle;" and lines
156. to the end, as "altered and enlarged by Tickle:" and at the
end is the following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are two or three other lines in different parts of the
foregoing eclogue, which were altered, or inserted by
Tickle&mdash;chiefly in the connecting parts. The first draft
(which was wholly Lord John Townsend's) was a closer parody of
Virgil's 18th eclogue; especially in the beginning and conclusion,
in the latter of which only Jekyll was introduced as 'the
poet.'</p>
<p>"Tickle changed the plan, and made it what it is. The title (as
indeed the principal subject of the eclogue) was in consequence
altered from 'Lansdown' to 'Jekyll.' The poetry and satire are
certainly enriched by Tickle's touches; but I question whether the
humour was not more terse and classical, and the subject more just,
as the poem originally stood."&mdash;<i>L</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probationary Odes No. XII. is by "Lord John Townsend."</p>

in some of the former, were inserted by

<p><i>Croker's Boswell</i> (Edit. 1847, p. 721.).&mdash;Mr. Croker
cannot discover when a good deal of intercourse could have taken
place between Dr. Johnson and the Earl of Shelburne, because "in
1765, when Johnson engaged in politics with Hamilton, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>{374}</span> Lord
Shelburne was but twenty." In 1765 Lord Shelburne was twenty-eight.
He was born in 1737; was in Parliament in 1761; and a Privy
Councillor in 1763.</p>

<p><i>Misquotation&mdash;"He who runs may read</i>."&mdash;No such
passage exists in the Scriptures, though it is constantly quoted as
from them. It is usually the accompaniment of expressions relative
to the clearness of meaning or direction, the supposititious
allusion being to an inscription written in very large characters.
The text in the prophet Habakkuk is the following: "Write the
vision and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth
it." (Ch. ii. 2.) Here, plainly, the meaning is, that every one
reading the vision should be alarmed by it, and should fly from the
impending calamity: and although this involves the notion of
legibility and clearness, that notion is the secondary, and not the
primary one, as those persons make it who misquote in the manner
stated above.</p>

<p><i>Tindal's New Testament.</i>&mdash;The following
Bibliographical Note, by the late Mr. Thomas Rodd, taken from a
volume of curious early Latin and German Tracts, which will be sold
by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson on Friday next, deserves a more
permanent record than the Sale Catalogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I consider the second tract of particular interest and
curiosity, as it elucidates an important point in English
literature, viz., the place (Worms) where Tindal printed the
edition of the New Testament commonly called the first, and
generally ascribed to the Antwerp Press.</p>
<p>"This book is printed in a Gothic letter, with woodcuts and
Initial Letters (in the year 1518).</p>
<p>"I have carefully examined every book printed at Antwerp, at the
period, that has fallen in my way; but in no one of them have I
found the same type or initial letters as are used therein.</p>
<p>"In the present tract I find the same form of type and woodcuts,
from the same school; and also, what is more remarkable, an initial
(D) letter, one of the same alphabet as a P used in the Testament.
These initial letters were always cut in alphabets, and in no other
books than these two have I discovered any of the letters of this
alphabet.</p>
<p>"The mistake has arisen from the circumstance of there having
been a piratical reprint of the book at Antwerp in 1525, but of
which no copy is known to exist."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is the title of the tract referred to by Mr.
Rodd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Eyn wolgeordent und n&uuml;tzlich buchlin, wie man Bergwerck
suchen un finden sol, von allerley Metall, mit seinen figuren, nach
gelegenheyt dess gebirgs artlich angezeygt mit enhangendon
Berchnamen den anfahanden</i>" and the colophon describes it as
"<i>Getruckt zu Wormbs bei Peter Sch&ouml;rfern un volendet am
funfften tag Aprill</i>, M.D.XVIII."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Term "Organ-blower.</i>"&mdash;In an old document
preserved among the archives of the Dean and Chapter of
Westminster, is an entry relative to the celebrated composer and
organist HENRY PURCELL, in which he is styled "our
<i>organ-blower</i>." What is the meaning of this term? It
certainly does not, in the present case, apply to the person whose
office it was to fill the organ with wind. Purcell, at the time the
entry was made, was in the zenith of his fame, and "organist to the
king." Possibly it may be the old term for an organist, as it will
be remembered that in the fifteenth century the organ was performed
upon by <i>blows</i> from the fist.</p>
<p>At the coronation of James II., and also at that of George I.,
two of the king's musicians walked in the procession, clad in
scarlet mantles, playing each on a sackbut, and another, drest in a
similar manner, playing on a double curtal, or bassoon. The
"organ-<i>blower</i>" had also a place in these two processions,
having on him a short red coat, with a badge on his left breast,
viz. a nightingale of silver, gilt, sitting on a sprig.</p>
<p>In a weekly paper, entitled the <i>Westminster Journal</i>, Dec.
4. 1742, is a letter subscribed "Ralph Courtevil,
<i>Organ-blower</i>, Essayist, and Historiographer." This person
was the organist of St. James's Church, Piccadilly, and the author
of the <i>Gazetteer</i>, a paper written in defence of Sir Robert
Walpole's administration. By the writers on the opposite side he
was stigmatized with the name of "Court-evil."</p>
<p>At the present time, as I am given to understand, the organist
of St. Andrew's Church, Holborn, is styled in the vestry-books, the
"<i>organ-blower</i>."</p>
<p class="author">EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.</p>
<p>"<i>Singular" and "Unique</i>."&mdash;The word <i>singular</i>,
originally applied to that of which there is no other, gradually
came to mean extraordinary only, and "rather singular," "very
singular indeed," and such like phrases, ceased to shock the ear.
To supply the vacancy occasioned by this corruption, the word
<i>unique</i> was introduced; which, I am horror-struck to see, is
beginning to follow its predecessor. The Vauxhall bills lately
declared Vauxhall to be the "most <i>unique</i> place of amusement
in the world." Can anything be done to check this ill-fated word in
its career? and, if not, what must we look to for a successor?</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>EARLY POETRY, ETC., FIVE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES
RESPECTING.</h3>
<p>1. Who was the author of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Poeme on the King's most excellent maiesties happy progress
into Scotland and much desired returne. May, 1685. Imprinted at
London, MDCXXXIII."</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id=
"page375"></a>{375}</span>
<p>It consists of ten leaves, exclusive of title-page, and is
signed with the initials J.R. No copy has been traced in any public
or private library.</p>
<p>2. How many leaves does <i>Nich. Breton's Fantastiques</i>
contain? I have a copy, apparently of a more recent date than the
one alluded to in "NOTES AND QUERIES" (Vol. i., p. 410.), wanting
the title, and probably introductory leaf; the text, however, is
quite complete. Where can a perfect copy be found?</p>
<p>3. There is in my possession a poetical collection, of which I
can find no trace in any library public or private. It is dedicated
to "Edmond Lord Sheffield, Lord President of his Maiesties Council
established in the north parts," and the following is a copy of the
title-page:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Northerne Poems congratulating the King's Maiesties most happy
and peaceable entrance to the crowne of England.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">'Sorrowe was ouer night</p>

</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Printed at London by John Windet for Edmund Weaver, and are to
be solde at the Great North doore of Paules, 1604. Small 4to."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four leaves not numbered, and twenty-two pages numbered.</p>
<p>4. Can any account be given of a sort of autobiography by an
individual whom Lord Orford sneers at in his <i>Anecdotes of
Painting</i>; it is entitled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Manifestation by Sir Balthazar Gerbier, K't. Job. xiii., ver.
18.; 'Behold now, I have ordered my cause, I know that I shall bee
justified.' London, Printed for the author, 1651." 12mo. 36 leaves
and title.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This very singular production does not appear to have been
published, and I cannot trace it in any catalogue. It gives the
author's descent, which is noble, and contains many interesting
personal details of Sir Balthazar, which cannot be found
elsewhere.</p>
<p>5. In the <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>, by Lowndes, there
occurs this entry: "Life and death of Major Clancie, the grandest
cheat in this age," 1680, and the full catalogue of the Hon. Mr.
Nassau is referred to. Can any of your readers state where a copy
of this production may be found? A brief account of Clancie is
contained in the <i>Memoirs of Gamesters and Sharpers</i>, by
Theophilus Lucas. He wrote, or there was written, under this name,
various other works not noticed by Lowndes. Can any information be
given as to the assumed or real author of these works?</p>
<p>Lowndes also mentions <i>Clancie's Cheats, or the Life and Death
of Major Clancie</i>, 1687. Where can access to this work be
obtained?</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>History of Newspapers.</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The materials for a satisfactory history of newspapers, lie
scattered in facts known one to this person, and one to that. If
each London or provincial journalist, each reader, and each critic,
who has an anecdote and a date, would give it publicity, some
future volume might be prepared from the combined supply, much more
complete than any to be fairly expected from a comparatively
unaided writer who ventures upon an almost untrodden ground."</p>

<p>The foregoing extract from the interesting volumes recently
published by Mr. Knight Hunt, under the unpretending title of
<i>The Fourth Estate: Contributions towards a History of
Newspapers, and of the Liberty of the Press</i>, has been very
kindly recommended to our attention by <i>The Examiner</i>. We

<p><i>Socinian Boast.</i>&mdash;In an allocution recently held by
Dr. Pusey, to the London Church Union, in St. Martin's Hall,
reported in <i>The Times</i> of Oct. 17, the following passage
occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Socinian boast might be a warning to us against such

<p><i>Descent of Edward IV.</i>&mdash;Professor Millar, in his
<i>Historical View of the English Government</i> (ii. 174.), in
discussing the claim of Edward IV. to the English throne, speaks of
"a popular though probably a groundless tradition, that by his
mother he was descended from Henry III. by an elder brother of
Edward I., who, on account of his personal deformity, had been
excluded from the succession to the crown." Where may I find this
tradition? or where meet with any information on the subject?</p>

<p><i>Viscount Castlecomer.</i>&mdash;Sir Christopher Wanderforde,
who succeeded poor Strafford as Lord Deputy of Ireland, in April,
1640, was created, between that date and his death, which occurred
in December of the same year, Baron Mowbray and Musters, and
Viscount Castlecomer. I should be glad to know the date of the
patent of his creation, whether Sir Christopher himself ever took
up the title, and what became of the title afterwards?</p>
<p class="author">S.A.Y.</p>
<p><i>Judge Cradock, afterwards Newton.</i>&mdash;MR ELLACOMBE
(Vol. ii., p. 249.), in his notice of a monument in Yatton Church
to "Judge Newton, <i>alias</i> Cradock," says, "the arms of Cradock
are <i>Arg.</i> on chevron <i>az.</i> three garbs <i>or</i>."
Richard Cradock, he adds, "was the first of his family who took the
name of Newton." Does MR. ELLACOMBE mean that the above arms were
those of the <i>Cradock family</i>, or that this Richard Cradock
assumed the coat as well as the name of <i>Newton</i>? The above
was the bearing of the family of Newton, of East Newton, in the
North Riding of York. The eldest daughter and coheir of John Newton
of East Newton was married to William Thornton, which family thus
became possessed of the estate of East Newton, and quartered the
coat assigned by MR. ELLACOMBE to Cradock. I should be glad to know
the occasion on which Richard Cradock assumed the name and arms of
Newton, as well as the connexion between these Newtons and those
settled at East Newton.</p>
<p class="author">S.A.Y.</p>
<p><i>Totness Church.</i>&mdash;In Totness Church, the N. angle of
the chancel is cut off in the lower part of the building, in order
to allow an arched passage from one side of the church to the other
outside.</p>
<p>The upper part of the building is supported by a very strong
buttress or pier, leaving the diagonal passage between it and the
internal wall. Can any one tell whether this was done merely to
afford a gangway for want of room outside?</p>
<p>The graveyard has been recently enlarged in that direction, for
all the tombstones beyond the line of the chancel appear to be of
late date. An old woman informed me, with an air of solemn
authenticity, that this arched passage was reserved as a place of
deposit for the bodies of persons seized for debt, which lay there
till they were redeemed.</p>
<p class="author">H.G.T.</p>
<p><i>Meaning of "Harissers</i>."&mdash;It is customary in the
county of Dorset, after carrying a field of corn, to leave behind a
sheaf, to intimate to the rest of the parish that the families of
those who reaped the field are to have the first lease. After these
gleaners have finished, the sheaf is removed, and other parties are
admitted, called "barissers." I have been told that the real title
is "arishers," from "arista." I should feel obliged if any of your
correspondents could inform me whether this name is known in any
other county, and what is the derivation of the word.</p>
<p class="author">CLERICUS RUSTICUS.</p>
<p><i>Ringelbergius&mdash;Drinking to
Excess.</i>&mdash;Ringelbergius, in the notes to his treatise <i>De
Ratione Studii</i>, speaking of great drinkers, has this
passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eos qui magnos crateras haustu uno siccare possunt, qui sic
crassum illud et porosum corpus vino implent, ut per cutem humor
erumpat (nam tum se satis inquiunt potasse, c&ugrave;m, positis
quinque super mensam digitis, <i>quod ipse aliquando vidi</i>,
totidem gutt&aelig; excidunt) laudant; hos viros esse et homines
dicunt."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says that he himself <i>has seen this</i>. Does any reader of
the "NOTES AND QUERIES" know of <i>any other author</i> who says
that he <i>has seen</i> such an exhibition? Or can Ringelbergius's
assertion be confirmed from any source?</p>
<p class="author">J.S.W.</p>
<p>Stockwell, Oct. 15.</p>
<p><i>Langue Pandras.</i>&mdash;In the Life of Chaucer prefixed to
the Aldine edition of his poetical works, there is published, for
the first time, "a very interesting ballad," "addressed to him by
Eustache Deschamps, a contemporary French poet," of which I beg
leave to quote the first stanza, in order to give me the
opportunity of inquiring the meaning of "<i>la langue Pandras</i>,"
in the ninth line:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"O Socrates, pleins de philosophie,</p>
<p>Seneque en moeurs et angles en pratique,</p>
<p>Ovides grans en ta poeterie,</p>

<p>Aux ignorans de <i>la langue Pandras</i>;</p>
<p>Grant translateur, noble Geoffroy Chaucier."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>May I ask, further, whether any particulars are known of this
contemporary and admirer of Chaucer?</p>
<p>I hope I shall not be deemed presumptuous if I add that I should
have doubted of the <i>genuineness</i> of the poem quoted from, if
Sir Harris Nicolas had not stated that it had been communicated to
him by "Thomas Wright, Esq., who received it from M. Paulin Paris,"
gentlemen in every way qualified to decide on this point, and being
sanctioned by them, I have no wish to appeal from their
judgment.</p>
<p class="author">J.M.B.</p>
<p><i>The Coptic Language.</i>&mdash;I read in <i>The Times</i> of
this morning the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Coptic is an uncultivated and formal tongue, with
monosyllabic roots and <i>rude inflexions, totally different</i>
from the neighbouring languages of Syria and Arabia, <i>totally

<h3>FAIRFAX'S TRANSLATION OF TASSO.</h3>
<p>On referring to my memoranda, I find that the copy of Fairfax's
translation of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> of Tasso, containing
the <i>third</i> variation of the first stanza, noticed in my last,
has the <i>two</i> earliest pages reprinted, in order that the
alteration might be more complete, and that the substitution, by
pasting one stanza over another (as the book is usually met with)
might not be detected. A copy with the reprinted leaf is, I
apprehend, still in the library of the late William Wordsworth; and
during the last twenty years I have never been able to procure, or
even to see, another with the same peculiarity.</p>
<p>The course with the translator was, no doubt, this: he first
printed his book as the stanza appears under the pasted slip; this
version he saw reason to dislike, and then he had the slip printed
with the variation, and pasted over some copies not yet issued.
Again he was dissatisfied, and thinking he could improve, not only
upon the first stanza, but upon "The Argument" by which it was
preceded, he procured the two pages to be reprinted. It is,
however, by no means clear to me that, after all, Fairfax liked his
third experiment better than his two others: had he liked it
better, we should, most probably, have found it in more copies than
the single one I have pointed out.</p>
<p>As your readers and contributors may wish to see "The Argument"
and first stanza as they are given in Mr. Wordsworth's exemplar, I
transcribe them from my note-book, because, before I gave the book
away, I took care to copy them exactly:&mdash;</p>

<p>I own that, to my ear and judgment, this is no improvement upon
what we may consider the author's second attempt, although I think
that the slip pasted over some (if not most) copies is better than
the first experiment.</p>

<h3>SMALL WORDS.</h3>
<p>I stand convicted by the critical acumen of your correspondent
[Greek: Ph]. of having misquoted the line from Pope which heads my
"note" at p. 305. I entirely agree with [Greek: Ph]. that the
utmost exactness is desirable in such matters; and as, under such
circumstances, I fear I should be ready enough to accuse others of
"just enough of learning to misquote," I have not a word to say in
extenuation of my own carelessness.</p>
<p>But I entirely dispute [Greek: Ph].'s inference, and am unable
to see that the difference detracts in any substantial degree from
the applicability of my remarks, such as they were.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id=
"page378"></a>{378}</span>
<p>What does Pope's epithet "low" mean? Is it used for "vulgar" (as
I presume [Greek: ph]. intends us to infer), or simply for "small,
petty, of little size or value"?</p>
<p>To me it appears impossible to read the line without seeing that
Pope had in his mind the latter idea, that of poor, little, shabby,
statureless monosyllables, as opposed to big, bouncing, brave,
sonorous polysyllables, such as Aristophanes called [Greek:
hr&aelig;mata hippokr&aelig;mna]. After all, however, it would do
me very little damage to concede that he intended the meaning which
[Greek: ph]. appears to attribute to the epithet "low", for <i>if
he did</i> mean "<i>vulgar</i>" words, it is evident that he
considered vulgarity in such matters inseparable from littleness,
as the "low" words must, if his line is not to lose its point
altogether, have been <i>ten</i> in number, that is, <i>every one a
monosyllable</i>, a "small" word.</p>
<p>Take it which way you will, the leading idea is that of
"littleness;" moreover, there is no propriety in the word "creep"
as applied to <i>merely vulgar</i> words, while words petty in size
may, with great justice, be said to "creep" in a "petty pace,"
requiring no less than ten steps to walk the length of a line.</p>
<p>Pope was criticising compositions intended to pass as poetry of
the best kind. Will [Greek: ph]. point out in any existing poem of
such profession and character, a single heroic line, consisting of
<i>ten</i> words, <i>all</i> which <i>ten</i> words shall be "low"
in the sense of "vulgar"? Can even the Muses of burlesque and slang
furnish such an instance?</p>
<p>Has not [Greek: ph]. suffered himself to be carried too far by
his exultation in being "down" (the last-named Muse has kindly
supplied me with the expression) upon a piece of verbal
carelessness on the part of</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Concolinel</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 217. 317.).&mdash;As <i>Calen O
Custore me</i>, after sorely puzzling the critics, was at length
discovered to be an Irish air, or the burthen of an Irish song, is
it not possible that the equally outlandish-looking
"<i>Concolinel</i>" may be only a corruption of "<i>Coolin</i>",
that "far-famed melody," as Mr. Bunting terms it in his <i>last</i>
collection of <i>The Ancient Music of Ireland</i> (Dublin, 1840),
where it may be found in a style "more Irish than that of the sets
hitherto published?" And truly it is a "sweet air," well fitted to
"make passionate <i>the</i> sense of hearing," and melt the soul of
even Don Adriano de Armado. The transmogrification of
"<i>Coolin</i>" into "<i>Concolinel</i>", is hardly more strange
than that of "<i>Cailin og astore mo</i>" [<i>chree</i>] (=my dear
young girl, my [heart's] darling) into <i>Callino castore
me</i>.</p>
<p class="author">J.M.B.</p>
<p>DR. RIMBAULT'S communication is very interesting, but not quite
satisfactory, not affording me any means of identifying the air. It
would under most circumstances, have given me much pleasure to have
lent DR. R. the MS., for I know no one so likely to make good use
of it; but the fact is, that without pretending to compete with DR.
RIMBAULT in the knowledge of old music, I have also meditated a
similar work on the ballads and music of Shakspeare, and my chief
source is the volume which is said to contain the air of
Concolinel. It will be some time before I can execute the work
alluded to, and I would prefer to see the Doctor's work published
first. Whichever first appears will most likely anticipate much
that is in the other, for, although Dr. R. says he has spent "many
years" on the subject, the accidental possession of several MS.
volumes has given me such singular advantages, I am unwilling to
surrender my project. I have the music to nearly twenty jigs, and
two have some of the words, which are curious.</p>

<p><i>Wife of the Poet Bilderdijk&mdash;Schweickhardt the
Artist</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 309. 349.).&mdash;JANUS DOUSA will find a
very sufficient account of Southey's visit to the Dutch poet
Bilderdijk, in vol. v. of the <i>Life and Correspondence of
Southey</i>, now publishing by his son. To the special inquiry of
JANUS DOUSA I can say nothing, but I would fain ask who was
Katherine Wilhelmina Schweickhardt? I have in my possession a
series of eight etchings of studies of cattle, by H.W.
Schweickhardt, published in 1786, and dedicated to Benjamin West.
My father was very intimate with Schweickhardt, and I think acted
in some sort as his executor. I do not know when be died but it
must be thirty years since I heard my father speak of his friend,
who was then deceased, but whether recently or not I cannot say. I
am rather disposed to think the event was comparatively a remote
one: he left a widow. Was Mrs. Bilderdijk his daughter? The
etchings are exceedingly clever and artistical; my copy has the
artist's name in his own handwriting. If I am not mistaken,
Schweickhardt lived, when my father knew him, at Lambeth, then a
picturesque suburb very unlike the "base, common, and popular"
region which it has since become. B.T. Pouncy, another clever
artist of that day, and a friend of my father's, resided there
also. Pouncy published some etchings which, although not
professedly views of Lambeth, were in reality studies in that
locality. When I was a boy I remember my father pointing out to me
the Windmill, which was the subject of one of them.</p>
<p>The Mrs. Bilderdijk who translated Roderick, was, according to
Southey, the second wife of her husband. How did JANUS DOUSA learn
that her maiden name was Schweickhardt?</p>

<p><i>Scotch Prisoners</i>, 1651 (Vol. ii., pp. 297.

notices these unhappy men, "driven like a herd of swine, through
Westminster to Tuthill Fields, and there <i>sold</i> to several
merchants, and sent in to the Barbadoes."</p>
<p>The most graphic account, however, is given in <i>Another
Victory in Lancashire</i>, &amp;c., 4to. 1651, from which the parts
possessing <i>local</i> interest were extracted by me in the
<i>Civil War Tracts of Lancashire</i>, printed by the Chetham
Society, with references to the <i>other matters</i> noticed,
namely, Cromwell's entry into London, and the arrival of the four
thousand "<i>Scots, Highlands, or Redshanks</i>."</p>
<p>These lay on Hampstead Heath, and were thence guarded through
Highgate, and behind Islington to Kingsland and Mile End Green,
receiving charity as they went, and having "a cart load or two of
biskett behind them." Thence they proceeded by Aldgate, through
Cheapside, Fleetstreet, and the Strand, and on through
Westminster.</p>

<p>"Many of them brought their wives and berns in with them, yet
were many of our scotified citizens so pitifull unto them, that as

<p><i>Julin, the drowned City</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 230.
282.).&mdash;I am sorry I did not state more clearly the inquiry
respecting the fate of <i>Julin</i>, which DR. BELL has been so
good as to notice. This is partly the printer's fault. I spoke of
the <i>drowned</i>, not the <i>doomed</i> city.</p>
<p>The <i>drowning</i> was what I desired some account of. "A
flourishing emporium of commerce", extant <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>{380}</span> in 1072,
and now surviving only in tradition, and in "records" of ships
wrecked on its "submerged ruins," does not sink into the ocean
without exciting wonder and pity. I knew of the tradition, and
presumed there was some probability of the existence of a legend
(<i>legendum</i>, something to be <i>read</i>) describing a
catastrophe that must have been widely heard of when it
happened.</p>
<p>This I conjectured might be found in Adam of Bremen; to whose
mention of Julin DR. BELL referred. But it seems that in his time
the city was still existing, and flourishing ("urbs locuples").</p>
<p>The "excidium civitatis," if the <i>Veneta</i> of Helmold were
Julin, must have taken place, therefore, between 1072 and 1184,
when the latter account was written. If Veneta was Julin, and
"aquarum &aelig;stu absorpta," there must, I suppose, be some
account of this great calamity: and as I have seen in modern German
works allusions to the drowning of the great city, and to the ruins
still visible at times under water, I hoped to find out the
<i>where</i> of its site, and the <i>when</i> of its
destruction&mdash;as great cities do not often sink into the waves,
like exhalations, without some report of their fate.</p>

<p><i>Dodsley's Poems</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 264. 343).&mdash;THE

<i>Collection of Poems, by several Hands</i>, was published in
1748, 3 vols. 12mo. A fourth volume was added in 1749, containing
pieces by Collins, Garrick, Lyttelton, Pope, Tickell, Thomson,
&amp;c. Those by Garrick and Lyttelton are anonymous. The four
volumes were reprinted uniformly in 1755. The fifth and sixth were
added in 1758.</p>

<p><i>Shunamitis Poema</i> (Vol. ii., p. 326.).&mdash;The titlepage

</blockquote>
<p>I know not the author; but I suspect either that the title of an
Oxford man was assumed by a Cantab, who might fairly wish not to be
suspected as the author of several of the poems; or that the
author, having been rusticated at Cambridge, vide at p. 84. the ode
"Ad Thomam G." (whom I take to be Thomas Gilbert of Peterhouse),

<p><i>Jeremy Taylor's Works</i> (Vol. ii., p. 271.).&mdash;It seems
desirable that an advance should occasionally be made in
<i>editing</i>, beyond the mere verification of authorities, in
seeing, that is, whether the passages cited are <i>applicable</i>
to the point in hand, and properly apprehended. Bp. Taylor, in his
<i>Liberty of Prophecying</i>, sect. vi., for instance, seems
incorrect in stating that Leo I., bishop of Rome, <i>rejected</i>
the Council of Chalcedon; whereas his reproofs are directed against
Anatolias, bishop of Constantinople, an unwelcome aspirant to
ecclesiastical supremacy. (See <i>Concilia Studio Labbei</i>, tom.
iv., col. 844, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>A passage frown Jerome's <i>Epistle to Evangelus</i> is often
quoted in works on church government, as equalising, or nearly so,
the office of bishop and presbyter; but the drift of the argument
seems to be, to show that the <i>site</i> of a bishop's see, be it
great or small, important or otherwise, does not affect the
episcopal <i>office</i>. Some readers will perhaps offer an opinion
on these two questions.</p>

Salisbury, as appears from the following marginal note in Dyer's

phraseology of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p>The book contains printed copies of the depositions of witnesses
who beheld Lunardi's descent; and Mr. Baker, who, as a magistrate,
took those depositions on oath, to establish what he thought so
wonderful a fact, erected on the spot where the balloon descended,

Strand</i> in its narrow parts," &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need hardly notice that by the removal of Exeter Change, the
alterations near Charing Cross, and the more recent openings from
Coventry Street, along the line suggested by Mr. Gwynn, his designs
have been so far carried out.</p>
<p>The second paper in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> was rather a
long one, No. 532., March 31. 1827. In it Mr. Gwynn's publication
is analysed, and all the leading particulars bearing on the "<i>old
novelties</i> of our modern improvements" are brought to light.</p>
<p>The whole is worth your reprinting, and at your service, if you
will send a copyist to the <i>Literary Gazette</i> office to
inspect the volume for 1827.</p>

<p>"<i>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis</i>" (Vol. ii., p.
267.).&mdash;This hexameter verse, which occurs in collections of
Latin apophthegms, is not to be found in this form, in any
classical author. It has been converted into a single proverbial
verse, from the following passage of Claudian:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>St. Uncumber</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 286. 342.).&mdash;Sir Thomas
More details in his <i>Dialoge</i>, with his usual quaintness, the
attributes and merits of many saints, male and female, highly
esteemed in his day, and, amongst others, makes special mention of
<i>St. Uncumber</i>, whose proper name, it appears, was
<i>Wylgeforte</i>. Of these saints he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some serve for the eye onely, and some for a sore breast.
<i>St. Germayne</i> onely for children, and yet will he not ones
loke at them, but if the mother bring with them a white lofe and a
pot of good ale: and yet is he wiser than <i>St. Wylgeforte</i>,
for she, good soule, is, as they say, served and contented with
otys. Whereof I cannot perceive the reason, but if it be bycause
she sholde provyde an horse for an evil housebonde to ride to the
Devyll upon; for that is the thing that she is so sought for, as
they say. In so much that women hath therefore chaunged her name,
and in stede of <i>St. Wylgeforte call her St. Uncumber, bycause
they reken that for a pecke of otys she will not fayle to uncumber
theym of theyr housbondys</i>."&mdash;(Quoted in Southey's
<i>Colloquies</i>, vol. i. p. 414.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>St. Wylgeforte</i> is the female saint whom the Jesuit Sautel
has celebrated (in his <i>Annus Sacer Poeticus</i>) for her
<i>beard</i>&mdash;a mark of Divine favour bestowed upon her in
answer to her prayers. She was a beautiful girl, who wished to lead
a single life, and that she might be suffered to do so free from
importunity, she prayed earnestly to be rendered disagreeable to
look upon, either by wrinkles, a hump on the back, or in any other
efficacious way. Accordingly the beard was given her; and it is
satisfactory to know that it had the desired <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>{382}</span> effect to
the fullest extent of her wishes. (Vid. Southey's <i>Omniana</i>,
vol. ii. p. 54., where Sautel's lines are quoted.)</p>

<p><i>West (James), President of Royal Society</i> (Vol. ii., p.
289.).&mdash;T.S.D. states there "has certainly never been a
president or even a secretary of the Royal Society, of the name of
James West." Your readers will remember that West is mentioned by
Mr. Cunningham in his <i>London</i>, as having filled the former
distinguished office: his statement, which T.S.D. thus contradicts,
is perfectly correct.</p>
<p>Mr. West's election took place 30th of November, 1768, and he
filled the chair until his death in July, 1772.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES OF BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>The idea of selecting from the <i>Spectator</i> those papers in
which the refined taste of Addison, working on the more imaginative
genius of Steele, has embodied that masterpiece of quiet thorough
English humour which is exhibited in the portrait of Sir Roger de
Coverley, is a most happy one,&mdash;so excellent indeed, and when
done, it is so obviously well that it is done, that we can only
wonder how it is, that, instead of having now to thank Messrs.
Longman for the quaintly and beautifully got up volume entitled
<i>Sir Roger de Coverley. By the Spectator. The Notes and
Illustrations by Mr. Henry Wills: the Engravings by Thompson, from
Designs by Fred. Tayler</i>,&mdash;as a literary novelty&mdash;such
a selection has not been a stock book for the last century.
Excellent, however, as is the idea of the present volume, it has
been as judiciously carried out as happily conceived. Mr. Tayler's
designs exhibit a refined humour perfectly congenial with his
subject, and free from that tendency to caricature which is the
prevailing fault of too many of the comic illustrators of the
present day; while the pleasant gossiping notes of Mr. Wills
furnish an abundance of chatty illustration of the scenes in which
Sir Roger is placed, and the localities he visited, and so enable
us to realise to ourselves, in every respect, Addison's admirable
picture of the worthy knight, "in his habit as he lived." May we
add that, on looking through these amusing notes, we were much
gratified to find Mr. Wills, in his illustration of the passage,
"his great-grandfather was inventor of that famous country-dance
called after him," speaking of "the real sponsor to the joyous
conclusion of every ball" as having "only been recently revealed,
after the most vigilant research," since that revelation, with
other information contained in the same note, was procured by that
gentleman through the medium of "NOTES AND QUERIES."</p>
<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson are now selling the last portion
of the Miscellaneous Stock of the late Mr. Thomas Rodd. This sale,
which will occupy eleven days, will close on Friday next: and on
Saturday they will sell the last portion of Mr. Rodd's, books,
which will consist entirely of works relating to Ireland, including
several of great curiosity and rarity.</p>

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>
<p><i>As we again propose this week to circulate a large number of
copies of "NOTES AND QUERIES" among members of the different
provincial Literary Institutions, we venture, for the purpose of
furthering the objects for which our paper has instituted, to
repeat the following passage from our 52nd Number</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is obvious that the use of a paper like "NOTES AND QUERIES,"
bears a direct proportion to the extent of its circulation. What it
aims at doing is, to reach the learning which lies scattered not
only throughout every part of our own country but all over the
literary world, and to bring it all to bear upon the pursuits of
the scholar; to enable, in short, men of letters all over the world
to give a helping hand to one another. To a certain extent, we have
accomplished this end. Our last number contains communications not
only from all parts of the metropolis, and from almost every
country in England, but also from Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and
even from Demerara. This looks well. It seems as if we were in a
fair way to accomplish our design. But much yet remains to be done.
We have recently been told of whole districts in England so
benighted as never to have heard of "NOTES AND QUERIES;" and after
an interesting question has been discussed for weeks in our
columns, we are informed of some one who could have answered it
immediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case the
advantage we may confer upon literature and literary men is
necessarily imperfect. We do what we can to make known our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id=
"page383"></a>{383}</span> existence through the customary modes of
announcement, and we gratefully acknowledge the kind assistance and
encouragement we derive from our brethren of the public press; but
we would respectfully solicit the assistance of our friends upon
this particular point. Our purpose is aided, and our usefulness
increased by every introduction which can be given to our paper,
either to a Book Club, to a Lending Library, or to any other
channel of circulation amongst persons of inquiry and intelligence.
By such introductions scholars help themselves as well as us, for
there is no inquirer throughout the kingdom who is not occasionally
able to throw light upon some of the multifarious objects which are
discussed in our pages.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
